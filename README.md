# LED Arduino weather display

# An easier, simpler way to forecast the weather

# Components:

- Arduino Uno R4 wifi
  I chose this arduino as I would need wireless access to fetch the weather data
- LCD Screen
  I needed an LCD screen to easily display the time and date so the user can know when each forecast is for
- LED strip
  This was neccary so users can easily understand the weather forecast using light and color. (Useful for users with short vision problems)
